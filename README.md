# Portfolio & Blog 

This repo powers [AlexWhiteside.dev](https://alexwhiteside.dev), with automatic builds and deploys from main via Vercel. 

You can spin up a free web IDE that handles all setup for you and exposes a live preview environment via Google IDX.

## Purpose

Provide a convenient yet customizable space to publish posts about things I've learned, what I've done, and resources I wish I had found earlier in my carrer. 

## Chosen Tech 
This project provides a no-risk playground to see how I feel after actually using some technologies I've avoided or dismissed, yet seem to be all the rage. I'll keep a log of these experiments, as well as call out the non-experimental tech I think is significant in [STACK.md](./STACK.md) 

This is intentionally not a complete list of tech used in this repo, if you are interested in that, the Gemini AI chat can help you out in the web IDE environment above.
