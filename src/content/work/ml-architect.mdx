Designed and led development on a platform to support our B2B2C customizable widgets and affiliate pages (1k+ partners, 2m+ monthly users)

-   Determined biggest bottleneck to be managing configuration schemas and app isolation
-   Defined a standards based protocol for apps (docker images) to attach their schemas as OCI Artifacts
-   Implemented a control plane using PayloadCMS, Kubernetes and H3 for configuration, which would discover Apps in the registry and load their schemas for use.
-   Implemented a lightweight routing service (h3) which would resolve and forward the correct configuration to the appropriate app
-   Onboarded 10+ FE Eng to deploy using the system and deploy their own apps, as well as Product / Account Managers to migrate partners
