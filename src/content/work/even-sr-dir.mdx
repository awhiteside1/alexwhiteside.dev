Led migration of legacy B2B2C codebases (React SPA)

-   Determined we were losing 10-15% of traffic before load by setting up network level measurments
-   Years of bad practices and poor architecture had load times up to 14s (p75)
-   Consolidated dependencies and merged into nx monorepo
-   Setup codesplitting by vertical and other performance tuning
-   Setup new infrastructure layer to allow incremental migration
-   Migrated in-place all network traffic

Ran a bootcamp for all Frontend Developers

-   4 hours a week for 6 months
-   Workshops focused on testing, modern react patterns, typescript
