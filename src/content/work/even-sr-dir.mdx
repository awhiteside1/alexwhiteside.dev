-   Years of bad practices and poor architecture had load times up to 14s (p75)
-   Led consolidation of dependencies and setup nx monorepo
-   Setup new infrastructure layer to allow incremental migration
-   Oversaw team migrating in-place all network traffic

Ran a bootcamp for all Frontend Developers
