I started Whiteside Photography after being ask to photograph families or graduation milestones, and over time expanded into weddings and selling wildlife prints.
- Provided on location photography services, editing and drop shipment of prints
- Partnered with a local beach wedding planner and local venues
- Created a custom webapp to allow for password protected viewing and ordering of prints
