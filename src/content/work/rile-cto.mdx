RILE is a [robotic interactive learning environment](https://www.facebook.com/rileinc/) that integrates an e-textbook, video lectures, activities, simulations, and demonstrations, classroom (non-robotic) activities, robotic activities, and homework activities, all in one. It was a joint venture which grew out of my research at UWF, collaboration with the Physics Dept, and investment from iSpace Inc. RILE, including spinoff "Discovery Spot", was used by tens of thousands of secondary school students in dozens of schools across the USA, UAE, and India.

I was responsible for developing the foundational technology for the platform, including the hardware design process and software architecture, allowing for precise manipulation and real time data analysis from 5+ robots in a classroom, each operated by students on their laptops over a web application and video streams.
- Developed custom Java based Server and Web Application software
- Developed initial hardware prototypes using VEX Robotics Cortex Microcontrollers which would join the network over wifi and managed by the server.
- Worked with founding team to design and implement initial integrated textbook material and experiments to best leverage the hardware.


Oversaw the Expansion of RILE materials, platform capabilities, and deployment into schools.
 - Hired 4-5 part time staff from the university community and managed their contributions
- Contracted with IHMC (Institute of Human Machine Cognition) engineers to develop custom PCBs to allow for more economical production of hardware.
- Coordinated demonstrations, presented at conferences and trade shows, and deployed the platform into schools in the USA, UAE and India.
