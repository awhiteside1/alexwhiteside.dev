I assisted in research and development of new designs for fixed wing aircraft prototypes at Eglin Air Force Base.
- Created computational fluid dynamics models in MatLab based on team defined algorithms
- Extended a vortex based CFD solver in C++ to run more complete simulation trials
- Helped manage a small custer of servers used by the team on site
