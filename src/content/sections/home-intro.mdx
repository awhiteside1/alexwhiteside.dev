I'm a hands-on, technical leader and staff<sup>+</sup> engineer who turns <TechIcon name="ideas" /> into robust <TechIcon name="systems"/> used by millions of <TechIcon name="consumers" /> and hundreds of <TechIcon name="enterprises" />. 

I believe in the power of simplicity, quality, and strategy to scale both systems and organizations.  

I bring <a href="/background" class="not-prose">10+ years of experience</a> spanning  <TechIcon name="engineering" />, <TechIcon name="product" /> and <TechIcon name="marketing" /> roles, providing a unique perspective to any domain.

I'm knowledgable about a wide range of patterns, platforms and languages, with particular depth in the <TechIcon name="Typescript" />, <TechIcon name="React" />, <TechIcon name="Kubernetes" /> , <TechIcon name="amazonwebservices" label="AWS" />  and <TechIcon name="Java" /><sup>*</sup> ecosystems.
