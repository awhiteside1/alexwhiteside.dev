One of the most frequent skills gap that I found in teams is infrastructure related. As systems get more and more complex and teams scale beyond a single application, dealing with infrastructure one way or another is critical. 

## Common Approaches

### Service Provider

The Vercel<sup>[1]</sup> / PaaS approach where you let service providers deal with it.

### Platform Teams

Sometimes called a DevOps team - a central group who gatekeep the infra and create an in house PaaS for teams.
