Quit Fernand core network front end is a platform that I developed at Even Financial, which was designed to solve the problem of getting new products or verticals developed quickly without requiring a senior developer to ensure things were good, while also allowing the business to scale more quickly, and at the same time ensure improvements across functionality were applied to everywhere. It was useful where it was relevant to. I was the primary architect and in the end, the primary implementer as well I'll describe that in a moment, but it was both an organizational shift.
