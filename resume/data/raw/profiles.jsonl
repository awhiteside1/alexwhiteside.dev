I have held technical roles that span a variety of areas including large-scale distributed systems, front-end technologies, data security, privacy through encryption, system reliability, and regulatory compliance. I have architected and led multiple planet-scale server re-architecture and associated data migration efforts with focus on performance, reliability and zero data-loss. I have built products that serve both consumer and enterprise audiences that work across different platforms (e.g., Web, iOS, Android, Tablet, Wearables). My latest role involves transforming Gmail into a modern communication platform powered by ML/AI technologies including Large language models (LLMs). In this role, I manage a global team of 300+ engineers across multiple geographical sites in North America. I collaborate closely with Product, UX, and Data Science teams, determine the overall product strategy and supercharge engineering teams for velocity and execution without sacrificing quality. Though my current focus is on Gmail, over years, I have worked on several horizontal efforts that span products including Drive, Calendar, and Chat. On the people side, I have managed large teams and grown leaders that hold senior positions inside and outside Google.","picture_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5603AQGn3Wq1IlA9-Q/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0/1725121468291?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=xg3JZhOy98jHqeIhlKTRRcTIRJe3E_Bs9DI8XL2BD3k","location_country":"United States","location_country_iso2":"US","location_country_iso3":"USA","location_full":"Cupertino, California, United States","location_regions":["Americas","Northern America","AMER"],"interests":[],"inferred_skills":["distributed systems","data security","regulatory compliance","data migration","data science","product strategy","product development","product launches","product support","public sector","engineering","running","security","encryption","reliability","compliance","server","architecture","ios","android","gmail","engineers","ux","science","strategy","director","software","responsible","smtp","indexing","typing","consolidation","less","digital","blog","cloud","youtube"],"historical_skills":[],"connections_count":500,"followers_count":1124,"services":null,"primary_professional_email":"js@google.com","primary_professional_email_status":"matched_email","professional_emails_collection":[{"professional_email":"js@google.com","professional_email_status":"matched_email","order_of_priority":1},{"professional_email":"jsundararaman@google.com","professional_email_status":"matched_email","order_of_priority":2},{"professional_email":"jaishankar@google.com","professional_email_status":"matched_email","order_of_priority":3}],"is_working":1,"active_experience_company_id":3252082,"active_experience_title":"Senior Director Of Engineering","active_experience_description":"Leading Gmail Engineering with focus on product development.","active_experience_department":"Engineering and Technical","active_experience_management_level":"Director","is_decision_maker":1,"total_experience_duration_months":226,"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_department":[{"department":"Engineering and Technical","total_experience_duration_months":226}],"total_experience_duration_months_breakdown_management_level":[{"management_level":"Specialist","total_experience_duration_months":24},{"management_level":"Director","total_experience_duration_months":55},{"management_level":"Senior","total_experience_duration_months":147}],"experience":[{"active_experience":1,"position_title":"Senior Director Of Engineering","department":"Engineering and Technical","management_level":"Director","location":"Sunnyvale, California, United States","description":"Leading Gmail Engineering with focus on product development.","date_from":"May 2023","date_from_year":2023,"date_from_month":5,"date_to":null,"date_to_year":null,"date_to_month":null,"duration_months":26,"company_id":3252082,"company_name":"Google","company_type":"Public Company","company_founded_year":null,"company_followers_count":37833418,"company_website":"https://www.google.com","company_facebook_url":["https://www.facebook.com/google","https://www.facebook.com/lifeatgoogle"],"company_twitter_url":["https://www.twitter.com/google","https://www.twitter.com/lifeatgoogle"],"company_linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/google","company_size_range":"10,001+ employees","company_employees_count":310167,"company_industry":"Software Development","company_categories_and_keywords":["technology/software","url shortener","goo.io","computers electronics and technology > search engines (in united states)","search","ads","mobile","android","online video","apps","machine learning","virtual reality","cloud","hardware","artificial intelligence","youtube","software","technology","engineering","customer service","adtech","application-software","cloud-platforms","cloud-services","data-storage","enterprise-software","video-advertising","artificial intelligence (ai)","cloud storage","search engine","seo"],"company_annual_revenue_source_5":307394000000,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_5":"USD","company_annual_revenue_source_1":null,"company_annual_revenue_currency_source_1":null,"company_employees_count_change_yearly_percentage":8.308744190269334,"company_last_funding_round_date":"1999-06-07","company_last_funding_round_amount_raised":25000000,"company_hq_full_address":"1600 Amphitheatre Parkway;

I could always count on Joe to deliver with a high-degree of self-initiative and tenacity. His output was high-quality, timely, and transparently communicated.\n\nJoe tends to ask the right questions, whether it is to deeply understand the problem to solve, clarify goals, or define constraints. I recall having felt in several planning sessions that I needed to be better prepared with sharper thinking or stronger proof. He regularly challenged me to bring my best. And, I believe he has that effect on everyone around him.\n\nOn a personal note, it was fun hanging out with Joe during late nights at the office. He is easy to talk to and has many interests, including technology, Stephen King novels, and movies. I find Joe to be supportive and generous (e.g., he introduced me to a fellow product manager) and would love to work with him again.\n\nI strongly recommend him.”","referee_full_name":"Eric Kim","referee_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/erichkim","order_in_profile":1}],"activity":[],"awards":[],"courses":[{"organizer":"CS 303","title":"Algorithms","order_in_profile":1},{"organizer":"CS 141","title":"Computational Problem Solving","order_in_profile":2},{"organizer":"CS 427","title":"Computer Graphics","order_in_profile":3},{"organizer":"CS 304","title":"Computer Organization","order_in_profile":4},{"organizer":"CS 241","title":"Data Structures","order_in_profile":5},{"organizer":"CS 321","title":"Database Systems","order_in_profile":6},{"organizer":"CS 243","title":"Discrete Structures of Computer Science","order_in_profile":7},{"organizer":"CS 420-03","title":"Enterprise Development Using Java","order_in_profile":8},{"organizer":"CS 423","title":"Finite Automata","order_in_profile":9},{"organizer":"BUAD 352","title":"Information Technology","order_in_profile":10},{"organizer":"BUAD 350","title":"Intro to Process Management and Consulting","order_in_profile":11},{"organizer":"BUAD 459","title":"Lean Processes","order_in_profile":12},{"organizer":"BUAD 437","title":"Managing Change and Organizational Transformation","order_in_profile":13},{"organizer":"CS 420-04","title":"Mobile Cloud Computing","order_in_profile":14},{"organizer":"BUAD 351","title":"Operations Technology","order_in_profile":15},{"organizer":"BUAD 317","title":"Organizational Behavior","order_in_profile":16},{"organizer":"CS 312","title":"Principles of Programming Languages","order_in_profile":17},{"organizer":"BUAD 461","title":"Six Sigma","order_in_profile":18},{"organizer":"CS 301","title":"Software Development","order_in_profile":19},{"organizer":"CS 415","title":"Systems Programming","order_in_profile":20}],"certifications":[],"languages":[{"language":"Spanish","proficiency":null,"order_in_profile":1}],"patents_count":null,"patents_topics":[],"patents":[],"publications_count":null,"publications_topics":[],"publications":[],"projects_count":11,"projects_topics":["Simple COVID Data","Daily Calorie Counter","SimpleFragments","Ugly Weather","PlexPyMonitor","PancakesOnPlates","Rover Android","Buff Buddy","GifJam","Marshmallow Matt","GitHub"],"projects":[{"name":"Simple COVID Data","description":"Android app that has some simple COVID-19 graphs of positivity rates, hospitalizations, and vaccination data.

A highly atypical group within the company, its mission was to drive forward-looking cross-functional programs, architectures, and research to help Cisco build a more unified product portfolio. I was fortunate enough to work alongside some prominent senior engineers (including a Cisco Fellow and a couple Distinguished Engineers), who were great mentors for the beginning of my career. A couple of the most interesting projects I worked on were in the areas of Cloud Storage and in Vehicular Networks. For the former, I build a proof-of-concept cloud gateway that provided policy-driven data tiering onto the cloud. This leveraged Cisco's Filesystem Virtualization technology (formerly NeoPath Networks). I worked together with the co-founder and CTO of NeoPath to integrate this functionality into the product. The latter involved defining the hardware and software architecture of a Smart Connected Vehicle platform, where we worked closely with many of the R&D labs of leading car manufacturers. My focus was on platform security technologies, such as Trusted Computing, Intel TXT, and Secure Boot. Other projects that I worked on involved setting up a public cloud infrastructure utilizing Cisco’s UCS and Nexus product lines and Linux KVM virtualization, initiating a Smart Grid architecture research effort focused on defining the architecture of Neighborhood Area Networks, and developing a distributed network measurement framework.

I team up with DevSecOps to manage our build pipelines, with QA engineers to implement Automated Testing solutions (Cypress/Playwright/Selenium), and I configure monitoring tools (New Relic, Sentry, Pingdom, PagerDuty) to track our database performance, health of our kubernetes (AKS/EKS) clusters, and maintain uptime and availability across our applications. I manage our release schedule and development workflow on feature branches, perform code reviews, trigger our builds in collaboration with DevSecOps who execute deployment, and maintain our teams' commitment to SOC 2 compliance. I audit and contribute to our Security training and org-wide best practices, as well as maintain our existing codebase and external dependencies - addressing vulnerabilities as they arise. I continue to contribute code across the tech stack writing mostly in Haxe and C#, working with Node.js and PostgreSQL. Over the years, I have hosted (and migrated) applications on Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.

TRE provides a transparent system through which students can interact with robots located in the classroom or in a remote lab. Most importantly, TRE Provides an abstracted environment, allowing the creation of different modules for different functionality based on student experience and the content being taught or exposed. This makes the system versatile enough for primary school students to solve a maze, or high school students to discover the physical representation of a derivative.

A student can remote-login via an application and perform experiments on kinematics on the robots and un- derstand the usually difficult concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration. The system was initially tested in a middle school for multiple batches of students at the 8th grade level. Initial reactions show that the students were engaged, interested, and excited. In particular, the excitement of working with real robots kept the students alert to pitfalls in the understanding of kinematics, as shown by their responses to qualitative questions on interpretation of graphical data.

I modernized the technology skill set of the organization through introduction of: ASP.Net MVC 5.0, multiple client-side JS frameworks, Bootstrap and NoSQL DBs, and accordingly strategized with the chief architect to define and document a new Best Practice Architecture which was actualized through a multi-year implementation plan. Finally, as part of our technology upgrade, I championed the sun-setting of legacy browser support realizing a cost savings through decreased development time, and fewer production support defects. I increased efficiency of the development team through a successful migration from Rally to Atlassian Jira, realizing a capital net gain of $20K/year in decreased licensing costs, and utilized positive momentum of the migration to shift the source repository from SVN to Jira Stash (Git), affording the development teams more flexibility in their code branch and release management processes. As the scrum master, I engaged with product owners to revise & improve the requirements gathering, release management, and SDLC processes to better align with agile development practices.
